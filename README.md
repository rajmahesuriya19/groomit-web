# Getting Started with Vite React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Vite React App](https://github.com/vitejs/vite).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://vitejs.dev/guide/build.html) for more information.

### `yarn preview`

For testing the build app locally.\
Once you've built the app, you may test it locally by running above command.

The `yarn preview` command will boot up a local static web server that serves the files from `dist` at `http://localhost:4173`.\
See the section about [preview](https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy.html#testing-the-app-locally) for more information.

This will run `eslint . --fix` and automatically add changes of fix the lint issues.\
It will fix those issues which are possible to fix automatically.
